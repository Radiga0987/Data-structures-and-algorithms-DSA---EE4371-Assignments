    "\n",
    "#####  Describing the sequence of numbers that would cause quick-sort to run in $\\Omega(n^{2})$ time when pivot is chosen as  the element at$\\left\\lfloor{n/2}\\right\\rfloor$th index\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "The time complexity of quicksort is decided by the final position of the pivot that is picked for a particular array.  \n",
    "We can make sure that quicksort on a sequence runs in $\\Omega(n^{2})$  by designing the sequence such that,it always  \n",
    "reults in the worst case scenario.The worst case scenario for quick sort results in $\\Omega(n^{2})$.This is the idea  \n",
    "that is required to solve this question.\n",
    "The worst case scenario of quick sort happens when the pivot is of maximum or minimum value.In this case,the partition    \n",
    "will result into 2 subarrays one of length n-1 and other with length 0(no elements).  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of the sequence\n",
    "To solve this question, our sequence should be of the following type:   \n",
    "The first requirement is that the maximum/minimum element is in the middle of the list($\\left\\lfloor{n/2}\\right\\rfloor$ index).This is the basic requirement.  \n",
    "Now, after the first partition, we will get one subarray containing all the remaining n-1 elements and the other subarray has no  \n",
    "elements.Now in the subarray with the n-1 elements, the middle element($\\left\\lfloor{(n-1)/2}\\right\\rfloor$ index with respect to this subarray)   \n",
    "should be of maximum/minimum value and this will be set as the new pivot.Now,from this new partition,we will get one subarray  \n",
    "with n-2 elements and the other one with no elements.Again, the middle element with respect to this subarray should be   \n",
    "the maximum/minimum.The same process is continued and hence, our sequence should be such that, this pattern is formed when  \n",
    "the partitions are made.This type of sequence will result in quicksort run time becoming $\\Omega(n^{2})$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**-The middle element with respect to a subarray can minimum or maximum independent of whether the middle element was a   \n",
    "minimum or maximum for the previous subarray that we had obtained(we just need it to be an **extremum with respect to the current   \n",
    "subarray**.Then, the run time will be $\\Omega(n^{2})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The basic logic used here is that quick sort performs the worst when the pivot element is maximum or minimum   \n",
    "and the worst case of quicksort has runtime as $\\Omega(n^{2})$.**\n",

    "##### Describing and analyzing  an efficient method to remove duplicates from a collection A of n elements\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code explained\n",
    "This question has been solved using mergesort and then some basic code to remove duplicates  \n",
    "from a sorted list.\n",
    "I have written two functions mergesort and merge,where mergesort uses the merge function in     \n",
    "its code to sort a given list in ascending order.So, after applying mergesort on the user given   \n",
    "list, we have the list in sorted order but now we have lost the order in which the original list    \n",
    "had its elements in.Therefore,to prevent this, under the duplicateremover function, i have made a    \n",
    "2 Dimensional list containing 2 coloumns and number of rows equal to number of elements in the list.    \n",
    "The first coloumn has the elements of the given list and the second coloumn has the indices of the    \n",
    "corresponding elements.Now, we can sort this 2-D list with respect to the first coloumn.When we sort     \n",
    "this 2-D list using the mergesort function, we have the elements of the list in sorted order along   \n",
    "with their original index position.  So we can use this index positions in the second coloumn later on   \n",
    "to preserve the order of the original list.Now that we have a the sorted list, we use 2 while statements    \n",
    "and append the first element into a new list and then we check whether the element we are currently at  \n",
    "and the next element are equal.If they are equal, then we increment the i value used so that we skip appending    \n",
    "the same element again.We use a while statement to do so.  \n",
    "Therefore, at the end of this process, we have a list with no duplicates.Now we mergesort our new list    \n",
    "with respect to the indices we had stored before, so that the elements regain their original relative order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Note: The mergesort function defined here always sorts with respect to the first coloumn of the 2-D list.\n",
    "Therefore, at the ending we have swapped the 2 coloumns so that the merge sort sorts with respect to the   \n",
    "indices.Then, the elements in the second coloumn of this list is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time Complexity  \n",
    "The mergesort function has order of $O(nlogn)$.  \n",
    "This is shown by solving the recurrence relation:  \n",
    "T(n)=2T(n/2) + n    \n",

    "#### Run time of counting sort:  (In this code only, this is not a general proof for run time of counting sort)\n",
    "1)2 lists outputlst and countlst of length n have been made in which all elements are 0.  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$This takes O(n) time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2)After this , there are 4 for loops each taking O(n) time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, \n",
    "Run time= O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run time = O(n)** for counting sort function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run time of the entire  code for sorting  :\n",
    "We apply counting sort twice, first with Placedecider=1 and then Placedecider= n.  \n",
    "This is done so that the first sort happens with respect to the right digit and then second sort happens      \n",
    "with respect to the second digit of the numbers in base n form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since counting sort is used only twice here to give the final sorted list, the run time will be given as:    \n",
    "Run time = O(n) + O(n)  \n",
    "$\\therefore$**Run time = O(n)** for the entire sorting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**:   \n",
    "**This method of sorting is stable.That is, radix sort is a stable sort.This means that the relative orders  \n",
    "of elements with same digits(either right or left)are preserved while sorting with respect to  a specific digit.**  \n",
    "This is required as we first sort with respect to the right digit.When we do this, if 2 numbers have the same right digit,    \n",
    "then we do not want their relative orders to change while sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of how countingsort works :\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Consider a input list lst of n elements with numbers in the range [0,k], where n and k are positive.   \n",
    "$\\;\\;$This list can contain duplicates too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2)The count/frequency of each distinct element is stored in another list and we name this list as count  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$which has size as k+1.Let x be an element in the input list (lst) such that its frequency is stored  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$at count[x].   \n",
    "\n",
    "3)Now, we update the count array so that element at each index of count, say i , is given by :      \n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$ count[i]=$\\sum$ count[u] $\\;\\;\\;\\;$where 0$\\leq$ u $\\leq$ i  \n",
    "\n",
    "4)The updated count list gives the index of each element of list lst in the sorted sequnece.Let the sorted  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$ sequence be stored in an output list(outputlst) of size n which is initialised to zeroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)Now we add each element from input list lst to the output list as follows:  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$Set i=0  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$a)t=lst[i]  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$b)add t to outputlst[count[t]-1]  \n",
    "$\\;\\;$c)decrease count[t] by 1   \n",
    "$\\;\\;$d)increase i by 1 and then jump to step a \n",
    "$\\;\\;$We do this till i=n-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now,outputlst will contain the sorted list\n",

    "##### Show that  quicksorts best case running time is $\\Omega(nlogn)$  \n",

    "Let us take take T(n) as the run time for quicksort on an n element array.  \n",
    "Let q be the index of pivot after placing it in the correct place.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write T(n) as:  \n",
    "**T(n)= T(q)+T(n-q-1) + O(n)**   \n",
    "The array is partitioned at index q and therefore we have to recursively call quicksort to perform  \n",
    "the same steps for the 2 parts with lengths q and n-q-1 and hence we get the above equation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in the best case, the array will be partitioned into 2 parts of equal length (n/2).  \n",
    "#### Important note:  \n",
    "**This is assuming n is a power of 2 . If n is not a power of 2 , we have to take ceil and floor  \n",
    "to prove this, but we will get same answer.For simplicity of proof, we can take n is power of 2**  \n",
    "**If we dont take n as a power of 2 , then the proof is almost the same as the proof in question 1 of this assignment.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that this is best case can be proved by some simple differentiation of T(q)+T(n-q-1)   \n",
