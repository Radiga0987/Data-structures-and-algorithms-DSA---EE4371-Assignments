    "##### Finding the maximum element of a given unimodal array in O(logn) time:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code explained\n",
    "Given to us is a unimodal array of distinct elements.We need to give an algorithm/code to    \n",
    "find the maximum of this array in order $O(logn)$.    \n",
    "Essentially, the logic applied in this code is the same as the binary search method for searching      \n",
    "an element in a given array.We initialise the lower and upper to 0 and the index of last element.    \n",
    "We find the middle element of the array and then compare it with the next element of the array.If   \n",
    "the middle element is lesser, then lower is changed to (mid index+1) as the maximum will be in the   \n",
    "right half of the list.If the middle element is greater, then we change upper to mid as the maximum   \n",
    "will be in the left half of the list.  \n",
    "Now, in either of these cases, we need to apply the same logic to the new half list, therefore we call    \n",
    "the same function with inputs as the updated value of upper and lower.This is done recursively until only  \n",
    "one element is in the list, and this element will be the maximum of the list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time complexity \n",
    "Cleary, this is a recursive code as it calls the same function multiple times.We call the same function    \n",
    "for half the size of the input list under every recursion.If we take the run time as $T(n)$ for n elements,    \n",
    "clearly,  \n",
    "T(n)=T(n/2) + a      $\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;$   where a is some constant  \n",

    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Removing duplicates from an array in  O(nlogn) time:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code explained\n",
    "This question has been solved using mergesort and then some basic code to remove duplicates  \n",
    "from a sorted list.\n",
    "I have written two functions mergesort and merge,where mergesort uses the merge function in     \n",
    "its code to sort a given list in ascending order.So, after applying mergesort on the user given   \n",
    "list, we have the list in sorted order but now we have lost the order in which the original list    \n",
    "had its elements in.Therefore,to prevent this, under the duplicateremover function, i have made a    \n",
    "2 Dimensional list containing 2 coloumns and number of rows equal to number of elements in the list.    \n",
    "The first coloumn has the elements of the given list and the second coloumn has the indices of the    \n",
    "corresponding elements.Now, we can sort this 2-D list with respect to the first coloumn.When we sort     \n",
    "this 2-D list using the mergesort function, we have the elements of the list in sorted order along   \n",
    "with their original index position.  So we can use this index positions in the second coloumn later on   \n",
    "to preserve the order of the original list.Now that we have a the sorted list, we use 2 while statements    \n",
    "and append the first element into a new list and then we check whether the element we are currently at  \n",
    "and the next element are equal.If they are equal, then we increment the i value used so that we skip appending    \n",
    "the same element again.We use a while statement to do so.  \n",
    "Therefore, at the end of this process, we have a list with no duplicates.Now we mergesort our new list    \n",
    "with respect to the indices we had stored before, so that the elements regain their original relative order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Note: The mergesort function defined here always sorts with respect to the first coloumn of the 2-D list.\n",
    "Therefore, at the ending we have swapped the 2 coloumns so that the merge sort sorts with respect to the   \n",
    "indices.Then, the elements in the second coloumn of this list is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time Complexity  \n",
    "The mergesort function has order of $O(nlogn)$.  \n",
    "This is shown by solving the recurrence relation:  \n",
    "T(n)=2T(n/2) + n    \n",
    "$\\implies$T(n)=4T(n/4)+ 2n and so on  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore$T(n)=$2^{i}$T(n/$2^{i}$) + in\n",
    "\n",
    "taking n/$2^{i}$=1,we get  \n",
    "i=logn  \n",
    "\n",
    "therefore,    \n",
    "T(n)=$2^{logn}$T(1)+nlogn $\\;\\;\\;$   ($2^{logn}$=n)  \n",
    "\n",
    "So mergesort has time complexity of the order $O(nlogn)$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The while statement has a time complexity of the order $O(n)$.    \n",
    "Therefore, since $O(nlogn)$ > $O(n)$,  \n",
    "time complexity of the code is $O(nlogn)$  "
