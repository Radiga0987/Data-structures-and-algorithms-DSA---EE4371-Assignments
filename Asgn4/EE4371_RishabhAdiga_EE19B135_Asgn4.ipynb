    "\n",
    "##### Show how to implement a stack using two queues. Analyze run times of the stack operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack is a data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:  \n",
    "1)**Push**, which adds an element to the collection, and  \n",
    "2)**Pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.  \n",
    "The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, **LIFO (last in, first out)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In queues , elements are added to the rear end of the queue and this operation is called **enqueue**(*in python this is done using **q.put(i)** , i is added)*.    \n",
    "But here, elements are removed from the front end and this operation is called **dequeue**(*In python this is done using **q.get()** , element at front end is removed)*.    \n",
    "Therefore, it is also called **FIFO (First in , first out)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question we need to use 2 queues to develop a stack.  \n",
    "There are 2 methods we can use to implement this:   \n",
    "**1)We can make the pop operation costly , or    \n",
    "2)We can make the push operation costly**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of the stack:\n",
    "Let us solve this question using method 1 **(pop operation less efficient)**:   \n",
    "Let the 2 queues be q1 and q2.    \n",
    "We shall use q1 to maintain ordering of the elements during operations and q2 is used for storing elements while popping.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When push is used, the element being pushed is directly inserted into q1.    \n",
    "When pop is used , elements in q1 are removed and inserted into q2 one by one until there is only one element or less.  \n",
    "Then, this element that is left over is popped.(Basically the last element is the element to be popped , so to access it,    \n",
    "the above method is used) . Also , when elements are removed from q1 and inserted into q2 , the ordering is not lost as  \n",
    "both are FIFO.Moving on, now the entire queue elements are stored in q2 and q1 is empty.So now, we rename q1 as q2 and q2   \n",
    "q1 so that the queue operations can be used again.The changing of names will take O(1) time as we are just swapping two   \n",
    "pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time complexity  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Push:  \n",
    "Push operation in this method takes **O(1)** time as it is just one insert command into q1. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pop:  \n",
    "Pop operation in this method takes **O(n)** time as it by doing n deletes and n-1 inserts and then the pointer swap takes  \n",
    "O(1) time.**( O(n) + O(n-1) + O(1) = O(n) )**\n",

    "**Proof:**  \n",
    "If we are given a binary tree which is already a right-going chain, then  \n",
    "there is no need to do anything.Otherwise, we will have atleast one left-going   \n",
    "edge in the tree.On this edge we can perform right rotation.After the rotation,  \n",
    "the child node will move to the right of its parent node, which implies that  \n",
    "the number of nodes in the right subtree is larger by 2.Also,for any node x which   \n",
    "is a left child ,one right rotation on the parent of x will add that node to the   \n",
    "chain and not remove any elements from the chain .Thus,the number of nodes  \n",
    "in right subtree grows everytime we do the rotation. Hence , after at most n-1   \n",
    "right rotations, the whole tree gets transformed into right-going  chain.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Solution for given question:  \n",
    "Now, using the above 2 features, we shall prove that any n-node binary tree  \n",
    "can be converted to any other n-node binary tree using O(n) rotations.  \n",
    "Let us take two different binary search trees which are T1 and T2 with n nodes  \n",
    "each. We need to prove that we can transform T1 into T2 with at most O(n)   \n",
    "rotations.First, we transform T1 into a right going chain, which takes **at  \n",
    "most n-1 rotations** as proved before.Now, we can transform T2 to the same  \n",
    "right-going tree using **at most n-1 rotations** again. But since left rotations  \n",
    "are inverses to right rotations, we can use left rotations on the the right-going  \n",
    "tree to obtain tree T2.This obviously will take **at most n-1 rotations**.Therefore,  \n",
    "we can convert any tree T1 to T2 and it will take **at most (n-1)+(n-1)= 2n-2  \n",
    "rotations** to do this.**O(2n-2)=O(n)** and hence the transformation from tree T1  \n",
    "to tree T2 can be done in O(n) rotations.\n",
